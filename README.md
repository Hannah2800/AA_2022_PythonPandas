## Problem description

There are three main objectives to this project. The first objective is "system monitoring" i.e., gaining a comprehensive understanding of the fleet's operational performance as a basis for business and operational decisions. The second objective is to gain insights into the different customer types and their behaviour through clustering. Based on these insights, new or better services or marketing measures can be developed that are specifically targeted at the identified customer types. The third objective is "demand forecasting" i.e., accurately predicting future demand to ensure a high level of service (e.g., by deploying additional bikes). Ensuring a high level of service will improve customer satisfaction.
